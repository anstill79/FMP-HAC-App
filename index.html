          follow-up care.</p>

        <h2>Landing Page & Patients List</h2>
        <p>After logging in you will arrive at the landing page. The Main button takes you to the most commonly-used
          section.</p>
        <p>The Patients list allows you to add new patients or work with existing hearing aid patients. The header has
          controls for searching and adding new patients. Each row on the screen shows you basic patient info such as
          name and MRN as well as the most recently-fitted hearing device. There are also controls to add new fitting
          records to the patient record and a section for managing clinic associations.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Patients List</h2>
        <p>After adding a new patient or finding the patient via search, you can enter the most recent fitting record by
          clicking on the patient or device name . If the record is empty you will be asked if you want to create a new
          fitting record. </p>
        <p>Clicking on the MRN will copy it to the clipboard. This is handy for pasting into Epic if needing to open the
          chart there. Also available is a Clinic Association section which is not commonly used but helps manage
          filtering behind the scenes so that patients fitted at other clinics can be incorporated into your clinic if
          the patient is seen at both (or more) locations. Lastly, errors or updates to the demographics can be edited
          from this screen.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Fitting Record</h2>
        <p>The fitting record is created at the time of device consultation. The fitting record contains many important
          dates and details about the recommended devices, clinician, clinic, insurance coverage, as well as follow-up
          care. Each fitting record contains one or more individual hearing devices. </p>
        <p>Wherever possible, the HAC App will fill in data automatically, such as your name and the date or date/time
          of an action as it is performed. Other details may be auto-entered such as clinic location, license number,
          etc. Creating a new fitting record should auto-enter many of these details when you create a new fitting
          record. As other clinic team members work on parts of the hearing aid order, delivery, or follow-up process
          their names and dates of actions will be logged as well. This is a powerful feature that allows us to quickly
          see the status of a device order or follow-up in one centralized location. Another powerful feature that
          relates to centralized data storage is that duplicate data entry is greatly reduced. For example, if one staff
          member is responsible for checking in new devices and logging the serial numbers, they will enter the SN once
          and it will populate anywhere we need it, such as on the Purchase Agreement or in a text blob like the one
          used in Specialty Comments.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Adding Devices</h2>
        <p>Each device has its own section in the fitting record. You can add new devices by clicking the Add Device
          button. This will take you to the list of devices available for fitting. You can search the list by
          manufacturer or model name. When you find the device you want to add, click one of the add buttons to add it
          to the fitting record for the right ear, left ear, a bilateral fitting, or 'Generic' which can be used for
          accessories or other non-hearing aid devices. </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Device Details</h2>
        <p>
          Each device has fields to enter the details for ordering, receipt, fitting, warranties, and other related
          data. A single device record may be completed by more than one team member, such as device options being
          entered by the audiologist while order and receipt details are entered by the coordinators. Certain screens
          will automate some of these data entry tasks, such as applying today's date to the Date Ordered field for
          multiple devices in a fitting record. Certain fields may also be used later on, after the fitting has taken
          place, such as return for credit or date of device loss.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Activity</h2>
        <p>The activity section shows a list of activity related to this fitting. It provides a place to attach
          comments, notes, updates, or anything else that may be useful in the management of this fitting. The most
          helpful activity entries involve send-out repairs or other types of repairs that are not scheduled visits with
          the audiologist. At a glance it is easy to see what was done, when it was sent out or worked on, when it came
          back, and what needs to happen next.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Insurance Coverage</h2>
        <p>The fitting screen also contains a section for entering the patientâ€™s insurance information. Click the button
          to see a list of current KP plans and coverages. When you find the plan, click on the name and it will attach
          the details to the patient's fitting record and calculate the coverage on the Purchase Agreement. </p>
